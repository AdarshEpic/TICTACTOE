TIC TAC TOE game using react native

This is a sample project code which i made when i was trying the React Native Framework.
React native is power full and well structured framework. It actually convincing me the same way i work on the Native Code Base.
Easy to learn and easy to understand, JSX syntax actually a good approach to designing the views.
Its pretty easy to work with react native repo. I am on my way to learning advanced concepts....never stopes.
